He spoke of an 'iron Curtain' that had descended across the continent, separating the democratic governments of the West from the communist regimes of the East. This speech is often considered one of the first explicit acknowledgments of the Cold War divisions."

This period, known as the Cold War, was not marked by direct large-scale warfare between the major powers but by a profound and pervasive ideological, political, and military rivalry that gripped the entire globe. It was a conflict defined not by the clash of armies, but by the struggle of ideas, the competition for influence, and a race for technological and military supremacy.\nThe Cold War began in the late 1940s as the euphoria of victory against the Axis powers faded, giving way to growing tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the two superpowers that emerged from the war.\nIn this chapter, we will unravel the complex tapestry of the Cold War. We will examine its origins, key events, and the various dimensions through which it influenced global affairs. The chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the era, exploring not just the political and military aspects, but also the cultural, social, and economic impacts of this prolonged period of global tension.",

The United States emerged from the war relatively unscathed, its industrial might bolstered and its position as a global economic leader solidified. In contrast, the Soviet Union, despite suffering immense human and material losses, emerged as a major military power with a commitment to spreading its communist ideology.\nThe contrasting experiences of the two superpowers during the Great Depression also played a role. The economic turmoil of the 1930s had exposed the vulnerabilities of capitalism, leading to widespread poverty and unemployment in capitalist countries. Conversely, the Soviet Union, with its planned economy, seemed to offer an alternative model that appeared immune to such economic crises."

The crisis was eventually resolved with the Soviet Union agreeing to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and the secret removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey.
